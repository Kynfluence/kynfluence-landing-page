              <p>
                Hi, I'm Bilal, founder of Kynfluence.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2021, I began building a small following of 5k people on Instagram. Like many content creators, I
                faced
                the daunting challenge of monetising my content.
              </p>
              I tried it all.
              <ul>
                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Brand partnerships had me hustling for months, only to yield a
                  disappointing $2,300.</li>
                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Desperate, I turned to selling merchandise, investing $5k of my
                  own money, but ended up losing $3k after eight long months.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I felt defeated and was on the brink of abandoning my content creator dreams.</p>
              <p>
                However, in the midst of my uncertainty, a lightbulb went off. I realised my audience followed me for my
                expertise, and that's when I uncovered the true power of selling digital products.
              </p>
              <p class="fst-italic">With renewed hope, I created a digital courseâ€”and it was transformative.</p>
              <p>Over two years, I sold the course to over 220 of my followers, generating an astounding $300k.</p>
              <p>
                I want to share my story with you as a testament to the power of determination and finding the right
                monetisation strategy. I understand the feeling of being stuck and disheartened, but I also know the
                incredible potential that lies in selling digital products to your audience.

                      and where to hire them from. You'll learn how to hire appointment setters, graphic designers,
                      commission-only salespeople, and funnel builders. Without an A team, you might as well admit that
                      you will be stuck at $5k per month.

                  You will be expected to attend at least the live core weekly sessions, which are 2-hour long sessions
                  each week. The rest of the program is self-paced and self-guided so that you can do them on your own

                  Free has no buy-in or commitment from you as a creator. If that were a viable option, you would have
                  already done it.YouTube videos are chaotic, confusing and sometimes just plain wrong. Free resources
                  on
                  YouTube aren't taught by experts, don't have live weekly 2 hour long step by step calls, and they
                  don't

                  I made over $300k with my own digital products in 14 months with only 5k followers part-time. I know
                  how
                  to build and scale digital products. I know all the steps and all the hacks. If you tried to sell a

                  1 a skillset/expertise that you can package in a digital product, 2 a following on social media.

                  The size of your following is not important. I made over $300k in sales with just 5k followers on
                  Instagram, the important thing is that you have a high engagement rate.
